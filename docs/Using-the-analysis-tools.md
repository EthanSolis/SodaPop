The SodaPop package includes a set of tools which can be used to analyze, extract and plot your data. Scripts are written in Bash and Python. In addition, R scripts help you plot results. A small bioinformatics pipeline can be achieved by combining scripts in sequence.

The following pages describe how to use the scripts in conjunction with the main program and its output. We tried to minimize the external dependencies required for the main program to increase portability and facilitate installation. These scripts were written with the intent to equip users with a minimal toolkit enabling the realization of informative plots and data analyses. Moreover, we sought an equilibrium between performance and code reusability. As such, we encourage those familiar with scripting languages to use the scripts as stepping stones for further analyses.
