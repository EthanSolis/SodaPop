# Results and analysis

The package includes a small bioinformatics pipeline to extract, analyze and plot your data. Scripts are written in Bash and R\* and can be used separately from the main program. Those familiar with scripting languages can also use the scripts as stepping stones for further analyses.

By default, SodaPop will always output population snapshots following the parameters input by the user. This ensures you don’t lose any simulation data. To toggle on automatic analysis, use the –a [--analyze] Boolean flag with your command (see section 5).
