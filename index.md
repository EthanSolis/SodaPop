# Welcome to the SodaPop wiki!

***

 **SodaPop** simulates the evolution of a population of asexually reproducing haploid cells with explicit genomic sequences. The simulation algorithm is adapted from the Wright-Fisher model with selection. The program can be used to simulate a wide range of experiments from population dynamics of simple single-gene organisms to complex metabolic pathways with many different gene products, each having its own biochemical/biophysical specifications.

The goal of this wiki is to demonstrate the functionalities of SodaPop and to provide useful and informative examples for its users.
