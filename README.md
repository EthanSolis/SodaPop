## What's this?

SodaPop is a C++ suite for simulating microbial and/or viral evolution in a highly customizable fashion. 

## Installation

SodaPop is set of command-line tools written in the C++ programming language using the C++11 Standard. To decompress and extract the contents of the downloaded repository, open a command-line terminal window, change into the directory where the download is located on your computer and run the following command
	tar â€“zxvf [zip file] 
Before you proceed with the installation, you may wish to move the extracted files to a folder of your choosing. To compile the SodaPop locally, navigate to the program folder and run
	make
This will use the provided makefile to build the binaries sodapop, sodasnap and sodasumm. If you wish to install the program to your computer, run the command
	make install
By default, the three components above will be added to /usr/local/bin. You can change this in the makefile by editing the content of the $INSTALLDIR variable.
